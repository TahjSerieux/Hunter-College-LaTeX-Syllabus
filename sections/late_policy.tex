Homeworks will be accepted up to three calendar days late for a 10\% reduction per day. The project will have a late policy of 5\% reduction per day up to 7 calendar days, at which point the project will not be accepted. For all homeworks and projects, the first hour late will only count for a 3\% reduction, before becoming a full day late. Assignments will not be accepted after the Final.
