% Example grading policy
Grades will be based on several aspects. The project, worth 35\% of your grade, will involve pitching an idea, designing and presenting your design, and then implementing and programming your project. You will work with a team of 2 to 4 other students. This grade will be determined in part by my evaluation of the project and in part by your team members' evaluation of your contribution. Periodic presentations and written reports, reporting on peers and progress, will account for 55\% of your grade. Professional presence and participation will account for the rest of the grade (10\%).
Listed below is the complete breakdown:
